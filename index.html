        <p>    
            Kittens belonging to the feline family are generally furry, small, and carnivorous mammals. Their common characteristics are their cute appearance and docile behavior. With their flexible bodies, soft fur, and marvelous patterns, they captivate the interest of many. Cats, one of the smallest species in the feline family, are usually kept as pets by humans for their companionship and ability to hunt household pests. They are simply referred to as "cats" without the need to distinguish them from other small cats within the same family. <br> <br>
            Cats are anatomically very strong animals. Their body structure is flexible, and their reflexes are fast. Their sharp claws make them skilled hunters. They are successful at killing small animals with their fast reflexes, sharp claws, and teeth. These attributes make them similar to other large cats within the same family. However, they have a very sensitive ear structure. So much so that they can instantly hear very faint and very high-pitched sounds that human ears cannot perceive thanks to their sensitive ears. Like most other mammals in the same family, cats have weaker color vision than humans. However, they can see nearby environments in the dark with their eyes. Their sense of smell is incredibly developed and, therefore, very strong. <br>

            <div class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
                <p>It is claimed that there are more than 70 cat breeds in the world. The number of cat breeds recognized by various international organizations such as CFA, TICA, and FIFE may differ. According to the International Progressive Cat Breeders Alliance (IPCBA), there are 73 breeds, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 44 breeds, and the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale FÃ©line (FIFE), based in Luxembourg, recognizes 43 breeds. <br> <br>
                    Although cats have the ability to hunt on their own in nature, they are social beings. Communication with other cats involves the release of scents, pheromones, and their unique body language, as well as meowing, purring, vocal tremors, hissing, growling, and guttural sounds. <br> <br>
                    This vocal and olfactory communication aids them greatly in mating during their breeding periods. Cats have a high reproductive rate. When properly controlled, they can reproduce and be registered as breed animals. However, uncontrolled breeding can lead to an abundance of stray cats. For instance, in the United States, the number of stray cats has reached almost 60 million. What about worldwide? When considering the failure of controlled breeding through spaying and neutering of domestic cats, along with the abandonment of cats acquired on impulse, unfortunately, this figure reaches billions. <br> <br>
                    The domestication of cats can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Cats were considered sacred and worshipped in ancient Egypt. <br>
                    In a genetic study conducted in 2007, it was revealed that domestic cats evolved from African wildcats in the Middle East region before 8000 BC. Today, according to the popular science magazine Scientific American, cats are the world's most popular pets.</p>

                <h1>Everything About <span class="clr-1">Dog Breeds </span>and Dog Types</h1>
                <p>
                    Dogs, with over 400 breeds in terms of appearance and size, are one of the species that have survived
                    from 12,200 BC to the present day. Dogs, as a subspecies of the wolf, also known as the Gray Wolf,
                    native to North America and Eurasia, are related to foxes and jackals. Like cats, dogs are a species that
                    has spread to the widest geography in the world. Along with cats, they are one of the two most commonly
                    kept pets in the world. According to an article published in New York in 2001 entitled "A Surprising New
                    Understanding of the Origin, Behavior and Evolution of Dogs," their population is estimated to be over
                    400 million. <br>

                        Dogs have a very long history. For more than 12 thousand years, they have served as a hunter, a protector
                        and a friend that humans have needed in their work. Over this long period, different breeds have evolved
                        to meet different needs. When looking at the first dogs in history, it is seen that their visual
                        abilities are very high and their sense of smell is sharp. These features made them excellent hunting
                        dogs and provided great convenience for humans in fulfilling everything they needed. Over time, changes
                        in the world and needs caused their genetics to change and different dog breeds emerged. For example, approximately
                        7,000 to 9,000 years ago, when farm animals were domesticated, dogs started herding them and underwent
                        artificial selection in this direction. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This evolution inevitably made their functions and perceptions different from society to society. For
                        example, when we look at Ancient Egypt, dogs were considered sacred. Today, they are used as guards in
                        many countries and as draft animals in some countries. In Europe, dogs are generally kept as housemates.
                        On the other hand, dogs preferred for helping the disabled and search and rescue are trained for more
                        specific tasks and used as police dogs. The fact that dogs are preferred in such diverse areas has led
                        to pet shop products and services for them becoming a billion-dollar industry.
